---Facial Recognition
    high-level overview of how you could implement this:

    1.Preprocess the reference images: Pass each reference image through the face recognition model 
      to generate an embedding. Store these embeddings for later use.
    2.Process the input image: When you get a new input image, pass it through the same model to generate an embedding.
    3.Compare the embeddings: Compare the embedding of the input image with the embeddings of the reference 
      images. You can use a distance metric like Euclidean distance for this comparison. The reference image with 
      the smallest distance to the input image is considered the best match.

    high-level overview of how you could implement this using the `face_recognition` library in Python, which can generate face embeddings:

    1. Install the necessary libraries: You'll need the `face_recognition` and `numpy` libraries. You can install them using pip:

    python
    pip install face_recognition numpy
    

    2. Preprocess the reference images: Pass each reference image through the face recognition model to generate an embedding. Here's a function that does this:

    python
    import face_recognition

    def get_embedding(image_path):
        image = face_recognition.load_image_file(image_path)
        # Get the face encodings for the face in each image file
        face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(image)

        if len(face_encodings) > 0:
            # If the image has one or more faces, return the first one 
            return face_encodings[0]
        else:
            # If no faces are found, return None
            return None
    

    3. Store the embeddings: You can store the embeddings for each reference image in a list or any other data structure that you prefer.

    python
    reference_images = ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]
    reference_embeddings = [get_embedding(image) for image in reference_images]
    

    4. Process the input image: When you get a new input image, pass it through the same model to generate an embedding.

    python
    input_image = "input.jpg"
    input_embedding = get_embedding(input_image)
    

    5. Compare the embeddings: Compare the embedding of the input image with the embeddings of the reference images. You can use a distance metric like Euclidean distance for this comparison. The reference image with the smallest distance to the input image is considered the best match.

    python
    import numpy as np

    distances = np.linalg.norm(reference_embeddings - input_embedding, axis=1)
    best_match_index = np.argmin(distances)
    

    In this code, `np.linalg.norm(reference_embeddings - input_embedding, axis=1)` computes the Euclidean distance between the input embedding and each reference embedding. `np.argmin(distances)` then finds the index of the smallest distance, which is the index of the best match.

    Please replace `"image1.jpg"`, `"image2.jpg"`, `"image3.jpg"`, and `"input.jpg"` with the paths to your actual images.

    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
